# Colony SDK

> Get started with Colony quickly

The Colony SDK is a community project aiming to provide a quick and easy way to get started to build on top of the Colony Network contracts.
The goal is to simplify the complexity of the contract's functions to serve the most popular functions using an easy-to-understand programming interface while providing sane defaults and fallbacks. We also provide a lot of examples for various applications to get you up and building with Colony in no time!
if you're impatient to start building, check out the Quickstart page. If you're already thinking that the feature set of Colony SDK might be too limiting for your use case, you might want to check out its bigger sibling, [ColonyJS](/docs/colonyjs), the almighty Colony API reference implementation (in TypeScript).
The Colony SDK is under continuous development and should cover the most common use cases and is constantly updated with new features.
