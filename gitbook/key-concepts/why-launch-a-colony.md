# Why Colony?

If you want to build a project with people from all over the world, you need a colony.

If you want to incentivize and pay contributors in a fair and transparent way, you need a colony. 

If you want to maximize your project's scalability, you need a colony.

*"DAOs are software arrangements that use incentives to trustlessly and permissionlessly coordinate economic activity in a network of rational, self-interested agents. Put simply: software that financially incentivizes people to do stuff."* -
