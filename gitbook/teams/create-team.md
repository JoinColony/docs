# Create & Edit Team

A colony is structured like a traditional organization: in **Teams**.

You'll always find **Root**, which is the "colony-wide team". You can decide to create as many teams as you wish, each representing a different area of your organization.

**Currently, you cannot create sub-teams, or delete teams.**

You can decide the **Team** name, define its purpose, and explain why you are creating it. You can change a Team's details later, but **you cannot delete a Team.**
