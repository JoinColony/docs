# Safe Control (Gnosis Safe)

Safe Control is a feature that allows you to override the multi-sig functionality of a Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) on another chain using your Colony’s governance mechanisms. For example, if you have a Safe containing tokens or NFTs, or you wish to govern the parameters of your protocol on Mainnet and your Colony is on Gnosis Chain, you could do so with this feature.

The following will walk you through the process of adding, managing and using your Safe within your Colony.
