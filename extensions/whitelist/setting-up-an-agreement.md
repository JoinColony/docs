# Setting up an Agreement

As part of the installation process of the Whitelist Extension, you have the option to set up an agreement that all users are required to sign before the take part in a token sale through Coin Machine. To create such an agreement, follow these steps:

1\. Select "Agreement only" or "KYC and agreement", as you wish.

2\. Paste the agreement of at least 100 characters in the box below.

3\. Click "Confirm" and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

4\. If you chose "KYC and agreement", continue [here](https://colony.gitbook.io/colony/extensions/whitelist/setting-up-kyc) at step 4.

Users will now be prompted to sign your agreement before they can take part in a token sale on Coin Machine in your colony.
