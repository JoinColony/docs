# âœ… Whitelist

Alongside the [Coin Machine](https://colony.gitbook.io/colony/extensions/coin-machine) Extension, a colony may use the Whitelist extension to filter wallet addresses allowed to take part in a token sale on Coin Machine.&#x20;

When using the Coin Machine and Whitelist extensions in a colony, it is the responsibility of the issuer to ensure being compliant with the local rules. Please make yourself familiar with the [Terms and Conditions](https://colony.io/pdf/terms.pdf).
