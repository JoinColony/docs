# Connect Metamask to xDai

If you have [Metamask installed](https://colony.gitbook.io/colony/get-started/get-an-ethereum-wallet) and unlocked with your password, Metamask will usually automatically prompt you to connect to the xDai network. If it doesn't, you can find the details for adding the xDai network manually at the bottom of this page.&#x20;

## Letting Metamask add xDai automatically

1\. Visit a colony on xdai.colony.io, such as the [Metacolony](https://xdai.colony.io/colony/meta).

2\. In the top right corner, click on "Connect Wallet" and choose Metamask.
