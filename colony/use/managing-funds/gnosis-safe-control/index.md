# Safe Control (Gnosis Safe)

:::info
Currently supported chains are **Ethereum Mainnet** and **Binance Smart Chain** (BNB). More chains will be added as suitable bridges are made available.

## Why Colony and Safe?&#x20;

Safe has established itself as a secure way to store and managed personal funds for individuals to massive treasuries for teams, and organisations. Providing a multi-signature framework, whereby in order for transactions to be made within a Safe, a set number of on-chain signatures are required to approve it. Making self-custodial fund management more secure.

The power of integrating a Safe with Colony, is you are then able to unlock the governance mechanisms of a DAO built on Colony to also be used to manage funds. Making for a more decentralised, scalable, and trustless fund management system.

### How can it be used?

Essentially, all actions you would like to perform from your Safe can now be controlled by a Colony and Colony's governance mechanism, most notably the Motions process.

So, anything from a simple token transfer, to managing NFTs held in a Safe, to arbitrary contract interactions from a Safe.

The integration also works across chains, so, you can have a Colony on the Gnosis Chain and use it to manage funds on Ethereum Mainnet.

### How it all works

This integration works using an Arbitrary Message Bridge (AMB) for cross-chain communication and a Safe's feature called Modules.

**Arbitrary Message Bridge (AMB):** The purpose of an AMB is to transfer arbitrary data between two networks, for example between Ethereum and Gnosis Chain). This data can be used to send a message to a contract on the other network and execute a transaction. You can [read more about AMBs here](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/amb-bridge/about-amb-bridge).

**Safe Modules**: Modules allow for external contracts to interact with a Safe and initiate transactions which can skip the need for the required number of signatures to approve the transaction. This elevates the functionality of a Safe to work with more scalable goverance mechanisms.

### Next step

The following pages will detail the steps required to set up a Safe to be controlled by your Colony.
