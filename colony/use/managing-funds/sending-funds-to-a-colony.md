# Sending and Claiming Funds

### Sending Funds

To send funds to your colony, you need to send them to the colony's address you find in the top-left corner of your Dashboard.

:::tip
Make sure to only send **ERC20 tokens on xDai** to your colony.
:::

:::danger
_Do **not** send ETH or any ERC20 tokens from Ethereum directly to your colony._ If your funds are currently on any other chain than xDai, such as Ethereum mainnet, you will first need to bridge them through [OmniBridge](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/bridges/omnibridge) before sending them to your colony. Otherwise your funds will be lost irreversibly. Before sending a significant amount of funds, it is advisable to send a small amount for testing purposes first. In case of doubt, please reach out on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Qjupxvg).&#x20;

### Claiming Funds

Funds sent to a colony address will not appear in the colony's treasury until they are claimed by a member of the colony.

You can easily claim funds in a colony from the colony's dashboard. If funds are available to claim, you'll see an **Incoming funds** section in the upper right corner of  the colony's dashboard. Click the **Claim** button to claim the specified funds.

You can see a more detailed view of a colony's claimable funds by navigating to its **Funds** page. This is found through the **Available Funds** link on the right side of the dashboard.
