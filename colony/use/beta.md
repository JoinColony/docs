# Disclaimers

You are using early stage software. It contains many bugs, both known and unknown. If you find bugs you would like to report, you can let us know in [Discord](https://discord.gg/feVZWwysqM).

We make no guarantees about Colonyâ€™s security or fitness for purpose; the Colony Network smart contracts are large, complex, and under active development, which makes audits impractical. While Colony has been developed with a defensive programming mentality, you must excercise caution and use Colony at your own risk.
