# Getting Started

**This is where DAO building happens.**

This section covers everything you need to know about using the [Colony dapp](https://xdai.colony.io/landing).

Colony currently runs on Gnosis Chain, so be sure to add it to MetaMask by clicking the button below:

<metamask-add-chain />

Or, [follow this guide](additional-guides/connect-metamask-to-xdai.md).

Looking to get a DAO off the ground? Head over to [Launch a colony](launch-a-colony.md).

Interested in contributing to an existing DAO? [Join a colony](join-a-colony.md).
