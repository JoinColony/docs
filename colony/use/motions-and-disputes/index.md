# Motions and Disputes

Motions and Disputes are the beating heart of your DAO governance. 

Voting is not an efficient way of making decisions, even in a decentralized organizations. In a colony, voting on proposals should be the exception, not the norm. 

In Colony, if everyone agrees on something, it's unnecessary for everyone to actively state that they agreeâ€”simply _not disagreeing_ is sufficient. Only if someone does disagree, and wants to attempt to prevent that thing from happening, is it necessary for people to actually vote. We call this principle "lazy consensus" and it keeps your DAO productive while keeping decision-making decentralized. \
\
The Motions and Disputes feature allows any member of your colony to propose a _Motion_ to take an _Action_ that will pass after a security delay unless somebody _Objects_. This applies to all Actions, such as creating an expenditure, managing funds, or managing teams.
