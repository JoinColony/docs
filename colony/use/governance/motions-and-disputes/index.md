# ðŸ§© Motions and Disputes

The Motions and Disputes extension serves as the core of your DAO governance. 

Voting is not an efficient way of making decisions, even in a decentralized organizations. In a colony, voting on proposals should be the exception, not the norm. 

In Colony, if everyone agrees on something, it's unnecessary for everyone to actively state that they agreeâ€”simply _not disagreeing_ is sufficient. Only if someone does disagree, and wants to attempt to prevent that thing from happening, is it necessary for people to actually vote. We call this principle [**Lazy Consensus**](../../../learn/dao-builders-toolkit/lazy-consensus.md) and it keeps your DAO productive while keeping decision-making decentralized. 


The Motions and Disputes feature allows any member of your colony to propose a _Motion_ to take an _Action_ that will pass after a security delay unless somebody _Objects_. This applies to all Actions, such as creating an expenditure, managing funds, or managing teams.
