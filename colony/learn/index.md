# Why Colony?

**Colony is the most powerful, practical, flexible, and easy-to-use DAO framework.**

### *Powerful*

Everything an organization needs to operate on-chain. Payments, Teams, Authority, Governance, Fundraising, Revenue sharing, Arbitration, the ability to interact with any other smart contract on Ethereum, and a whole lot more.

### *Practical*

In a healthy organization, voting should be rare. That's why Colony operates a more agile system of 'lazy consensus'. It means organizations spend their time productively, not endlessly voting.

### *Flexible*

Colony Core provides powerful primitives for finances, org structure, and authority. Extensions are plug-ins that build on those, shaping organizations according to their needs.

### *Easy*

Colony makes DAOs easy. Unlike the complicated, clunky competition, Colony's application seamlessly integrates powerful DAO functionality into a polished, logical, and easy to use experience.

## What are DAOs?

DAOs are software arrangements that use incentives to trustlessly and permissionlessly coordinate economic activity in a network of rational, self-interested agents. Put simply: software that financially incentivizes people to do stuff.
