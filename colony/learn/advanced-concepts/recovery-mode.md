# Recovery mode

The Recovery mode allows you to "lock" your Colony and prevent any further activity from happening. You will need to have the *Recovery* [permission](./permissions.md#recovery) to put your Colony into Recovery mode.

:::caution
Leaving recovery requires the approval of a majority of members holding the Recovery permission.
