# Recovery Mode

Sometimes, you just need to pull on the emergency break.

The Recovery mode allows you to "lock" your colony and prevent any further activity from happening. You will need to have the *Recovery* [permission](./permissions.md#recovery) to put your colony into Recovery mode.

Find out how to enable recovery mode [**here**](../../use/advanced-features/recovery-mode.md).

:::caution
Leaving Recovery Mode requires the approval of a majority of members holding the Recovery permission.
