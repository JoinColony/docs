# Motions

**Motions** are reputation-based governance processes that automatically trigger outcomes on the blockchain. 

Whether you're paying contributors, managing a DAO treasury, or creating teams, Motions allow your DAO to carry out actions without the need for a trusted third party. Motions follow the [Lazy Consensus](lazy-consensus.md) model.

Does your DAO want to decide on proposals that cannot be executed automatically? That's where [Simple Decisions](simple-decisions.md) come in.
