# ðŸ§© Extensions

Every DAO has different needs, which is why Colony aims to be as flexible and modular as possible. 

**Extensions** are Colony's way of giving DAO builders the tools they need to achieve their goals, without overloading contributors with unnecessary features. 

It's up to each individual colony to decide on which extensions to enable or disable, and how to adjust their parameters.

In this documentation, extensions are labeled with the ðŸ§© emoji.
