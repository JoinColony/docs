# Installation

:::hint
Whitelist is currently available to the [Metacolony](https://xdai.colony.io/colony/meta) only and will be rolled out to all existing and new colonies starting Q1 2022.
:::

The Whitelist Extension is used in combination with the [Coin Machine](https://colony.gitbook.io/colony/extensions/coin-machine) Extension which needs to be installed and set up separately, as described [here](https://colony.gitbook.io/colony/extensions/coin-machine). This guide describes how to install and set up the Whitelist Extension only.&#x20;

To see whether the Extension is already installed, navigate to "Extensions" on the left-hand side of your colony. If it is listed under "Installed Extensions" and enabled but not deprecated, you are good to go. Otherwise, follow the instructions below.

1\. Make sure your account has [Root permissions](../../advanced-features/permissions.md) or speak to someone who holds your colony's Root permission.

2\. Click on "Extensions", select "Whitelist", click on "Install" and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

3\. Click on "Enable" and continue with setting up an [agreement](https://colony.gitbook.io/colony/extensions/whitelist/setting-up-an-agreement), [know your customer (KYC) standards](https://colony.gitbook.io/colony/extensions/whitelist/setting-up-kyc), or both. These parameters cannot be changed after enabling it. To do so, you must uninstall the extension, and then install and enable it again with new parameters. To proceed, click on "Confirm" and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

4\. Once all transactions are confirmed and the status changes from "Disabled" to "Enabled", the extension has been successfully installed.
