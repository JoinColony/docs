# Earning Reputation in a Colony

**After you [join a colony](../join-a-colony.md), you'll need to earn some reputation before you can participate in governance.**

The most common way of earning reputation is by [getting paid](../managing-funds/payments.md) in the colony's native token. 

:::tip
Payments in stablecoins will not provide reputation. You can use stablecoin payments to adjust for cost-of-living requirements for contributors, or any other situation where making a payment without giving additional reputation is appropriate. 
:::

Reputation can also be [manually awarded](award-reputation.md) in special circumstances, such as when launching a new colony with an existing team.

Each colony will have its own rationale for paying contributors. Some colonies may pay contributors for approved content or codebase contributions, while other colonies may send you some native tokens just for asking nicely.
