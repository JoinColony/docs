# Beta! ⚠️

You are using very early stage software. It contains many bugs, both known and unknown. If you find bugs you would like to report, you can do so on [Productboard](https://portal.productboard.com/colony/1-colony-portal/tabs/4-bugs).&#x20;

We make no guarantees about Colony’s security or fitness for purpose; the Colony Network smart contracts are large, complex, and under active development, which makes audit impractical. While Colony has been developed with a defensive programming mentality, it would be imprudent to deposit your project’s entire treasury to your colony right away. We’re looking into some ways to attenuate this concern, but for now, exercise caution: by using Colony you accept that you are doing so at your own risk.
