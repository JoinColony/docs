# Native Tokens

Every colony has its own native token that complements its reputation. Payment in a colonyâ€™s native token confers **reputation** **in the team from which it was received, as well as all parent Teams, including Root.**

**They do not earn any reputation in child Teams, as well as siblings Teams.**

Both internal tokens and reputation are required to create motions, raise disputes, and vote.

Users can decide to adopt an [existing ERC20 token](../creator-forge/quickstart-guide.md#step-2b-using-an-existing-token) as their native token (i.e. DAI or _USDC_), or to [create a new one](../creator-forge/quickstart-guide.md#step-2a-creating-a-new-token). Native Tokens are a key aspect when creating a new colony. To know more, please read [Selecting Colony Native Token](../creator-forge/native-tokens.md).

You can also check the Native Token contract address and add it to your Metamask.

A colony native tokens are locked and non-transferrable by default. They can be [unlocked](../manage-funds/unlock-token.md) anytime, so that they may be freely transferred between accounts. **** This action is irreversible and only applies to new tokens created with Colony.
