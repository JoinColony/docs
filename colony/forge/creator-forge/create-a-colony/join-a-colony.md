# Join a Colony

To join a colony, simply click the "**join**" button next to the colony's name.

That colony will then appear in the list of colonies on the left of your screen, along with being displayed in your profile.

However, to truly call yourself a member of the colony, you'll need to earn some [Reputation](../key-concepts/reputation/) in the colony.
