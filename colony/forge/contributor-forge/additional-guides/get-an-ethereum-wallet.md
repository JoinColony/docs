# Get a Wallet and xDai

To create a Colony account, you need an Ethereum wallet and a little bit of xDai tokens to pay for transaction fees.

## Ethereum Wallet

[Metamask](https://metamask.io/) is one of the simplest ways to get and manage an Ethereum address. It is a free-to-use browser extension, you can read more about it and how to install it in their [getting started guide](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-Started-With-MetaMask-Part-1-). Make sure to choose a secure password and both your password and your seed phrase in a safe place, such as a password manager. Never reveal your seed phrase to anyone.

For additional security, you have the option to use a hardware wallet. Metamask [supports](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020394612-How-to-connect-a-Trezor-or-Ledger-Hardware-Wallet) hardware wallets from Trezor and Ledger.

## xDai tokens

:::note
Colony is now offering MetaTransactions, which covers your gas fees for Colony on the Gnosis Chain, meaning you no longer need xDai tokens to use Colony.\
You can [read more about it here](../../creator-forge/advanced-features/metatransactions.md).&#x20;
:::

Since Colony runs on the Gnosis Chain network, transaction fees are extremely cheap compared to Ethereum mainnet - but not free. To cover transaction fees while using Colony, you need xDai tokens.&#x20;

For creating a new colony, 0.1 XDAI are usually sufficient. Once a colony is created, 0.01 XDAI will be sufficient for using a colony for months.

### Faucet for smaller amounts

So-called [faucets](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/get-xdai-tokens/xdai-faucet) are a convenient way to receive a small amount of xDai instantly and for free.

### Sources for larger amounts

To receive larger amounts of xDai, you can either buy xDai directly or bridge funds from another blockchain and exchanges.

**1. Bridge DAI across chains**

a. To bridge from Ethereum use [https://bridge.xdaichain.com](https://bridge.xdaichain.com/)

b. To bridge DAI from Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, or various other chains you can use one of the following 3rd party token bridges:

* [https://www.xpollinate.io/](https://www.xpollinate.io/)
* [https://hop.exchange/](https://hop.exchange/)
* [https://cbridge.celer.network/#/](https://cbridge.celer.network/#/)
* [https://app.elk.finance/#/elknet](https://app.elk.finance/#/elknet)
* [https://oportal.boringdao.com/twoway](https://oportal.boringdao.com/twoway)

Once you have bridged, please double-check that you have actually swapped to xDai and not DAI, as DAI is also on xDai chain as an ERC20 token.

**2. Alternatively, you can buy xDai with fiat via:**

* [Ramp](https://ramp.network/buy/?swapAsset=XDAI)
* [Mt Pelerin](https://www.mtpelerin.com/buy-xdai)
* for USDT on [AscendEX (BitMax) with the xDai/USDT Pair](https://ascendex.com/en/basic/cashtrade-spottrading/usdt/xdai)

Note that some options to buy xDai with fiat incur high fees. Especially for higher amounts, bridging DAI from another blockchain may be much cheaper.
