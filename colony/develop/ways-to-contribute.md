# Contribute to Colony

If you are passionate about decentralization or DAOs and want to help shape the future of organizations, then contributing to the Colony project is a fantastic opportunity. Colony is a decentralized platform that enables anyone to create, manage, and participate in decentralized organizations on the blockchain. Whether you are a web developer, Solidity developer, security researcher, or just have general interest in DAOs, you can get involved and make a difference.

## Web Developers

As a web developer (web2 or web3), you can contribute to the Colony decentralized application (dApp) by looking for issues tagged with "good-first-issue" in the GitHub issue tracker. You'll find a wealth of opportunities to make an impact and improve the user experience for our growing community of decentralized organizations. Whether you're working on front-end, back-end, or anything in between, you're sure to find a way to contribute to the project. Check out the issue tracker here: https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyCDapp.
Additionally, you can also help build and shape our software development kit (SDK) called the Colony SDK. This can be found here: https://github.com/JoinColony/colonySDK. 

## Community Projects

You can also start or contribute to one of the Colony community projects. Whether you're interested in building tools, applications, or other resources to help decentralized organizations get started, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved. Check out the following page for more information on the community projects: https://colony.notion.site/Buidl-with-Colony-c53284735eaa4d67ac9b4f0cc87e8618

## Solidity Developers

If you are a Solidity developer, you can contribute to the Colony Network by checking out our smart contracts on GitHub. Find issues with the "good-first-issue" tag and help us improve the underlying infrastructure that powers the Colony platform. You can find the smart contracts here: https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork.

## Security Researchers

If you're a security researcher, you can help secure the Colony platform by participating in our bug-bounty program. The bug-bounty program rewards responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you find a vulnerability, please report it through the bug-bounty program: https://docs.colony.io/colonynetwork/bug-bounty.

## Get in Touch

If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, you can reach out to Chris, the community manager, by email at chris@colony.io or in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/feVZWwysqM) at chmanie#5800. We're always looking for ways to grow the Colony community and help more people get involved, so don't hesitate to reach out.
